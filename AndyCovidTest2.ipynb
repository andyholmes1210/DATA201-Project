    "We were interested in finding data on wellbeing or attitudes within the population and seeing how and if these had changed over the past 2 years because of Covid. Pertinent data was found on the Stats NZ website, with xlsx files on wellbeing available for the periods of June, September, and December of 2020, and March of 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "These files were chosen as they weren't presented in a immediately usable format and would require a certain amount of wrangling and tidying; there is a large amount of empty cells and half-used columns, and so would require some work to get into a usuable and presentable format. At the same time the different files were mostly consistent in their formatting, and so the coding that was created for one file would work on all the others (with some discrepancies to account for).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the files also contained data that was interesting and that we thought would be valuable to our 'story'. What was found in the data was the average rating of trust in NZ's health system by region, and so we were interested to see how this had changed, if at all, over the available time frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficulties arose when initially we attempted to collect the data on different ratings of trust in the health system as opposed to the average trust. This was due to the rows being identified in a non-unique manner. Indexing into the rows themselves wouldn't work due to discrepenancies between files on where these rows actually existed. A workable solution was found by breaking up and merging the identifying columns and finding a specific row identifier, and its following rows. Though given the seemingly arbitrary nature of the different ratings and the difficulty posed in how to present these in an understandable manner, we changed to just collecting the data that was relevant to just the average trust rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques used on each file returns a tidy dataframe of just the regions of interest, and their average rating of trust in the health system.\n",
    "To do this the correct columns need to be extracted from the files, which was acheived using a 'select_if' function, to take only the columns that were titled to the regions of interest. Removal of NA rows first had to be done so that the region values themselves became column names.\n",
    "The gather function was also used after the desired data was extracted to turn the column regional names into values within their own column, pairing with their extracted average trust value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these tidy frames was then ammended to have an additional column attached to contain the relevant date of the data, and subsequently these seperate dataframes were combined into one so that all the data can be passed into a graphing function where we can group by the different regions, plotting each of their average trust values and their change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We managed to achieve this for all the relevant datasets available, and thus managed to produce a plot demonstrating how the average trust in NZ's health system has changed over a 12 month time period, and how this has changed for different regions within NZ. What we found was that average trust had decreased from June 2020 to March this year. Presuming future datasets follow a specific format, there should be no issue with incorporating newer datasets with what already exists.\n",
    "What we have failed to do was combine this with the vaccination rates data due to a lack of overlap of the time periods for the data itself, and so we have failed to see how and if the average trust has increased or continued to decrease as vaccines have been introduced."
